# Contribute to `fosanalysis`

## Issues, Feature Requests, Implementation and Integration
Thanks for considering to contribute to `fosanalysis`, any contribution is highly appreciated.
In order to contribute in a helpful way, please read the following guideline.

### Creating Issues
In order to pinpoint a problem, please provide at least:
- the expected behaviour (What did you want to achieve?),
- the experienced behaviour (What happend?),
- the function and preferably file and line, which are problemativ (Where is the error?),
- the state of your installation (i.e. commit hash, release tag),
- an example to reproduce the error: if not suitable as inline code, as a link to the file,
- (optional, but highly appreciated) proposal for a fix (see Implement features)

### Feature requests
Feature requests are mostly treated equivalent to Issues.
However, since this functionality is not yet present please make clear:
- shortcoming of the current implementation (What is currently impossible?),
- usecase of the requested functionality (How could this be used?),
- proposal of the interface/implementation (How would you expect it to work? How would you implement it?)
- related literature (no uploads, but as link, e.g. DOI, URL or alike)

### Implement features
If you want to contribute by coding, it is highly appreciated.
However, to keep it clean, please use the following workflow.
1. Clone the repository and create a new branch (e.g. `<working_branch_name>`).
2. Assign the issue to yourself.
3. Work on your feature. Document everything using `doxygen`. Undocumented code is unusable code and will be rejected, even if the code itself is nice.
4. When you think, you are done, open a Merge request.
  This includes: 
    - Patch notes (What did you change?).
      Describe it in such a detail, that is enough to read the merge request to understand everything, that happened.
      But keep it as concise as possible. 
    - Link related Issues (Which issues are solved?)
    - Set yourself as assignee.
    - Set a reviewer.
5. Tag a reviewer (request review).
6. Wait for review, discuss and resolve the remaining problems (go back to 3.).
7. If everything is resolved, `<working_branch_name>` will be merged for you.
