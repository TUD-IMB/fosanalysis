# fosanalyis -- A framework to calculate crack widths from fiber optic sensor data

This project provides a framework for crack width calculation through strain measurement by fiber optic sensors.

`fosanalysis` is developed under Python 3.9 and is available in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/fosanalysis/).
To install the latest stable version, please run:
- Linux and Mac: `python3 -m pip install -U fosanalysis`
- Windows: `py -m pip install -U fosanalysis`

A quick guide on how to use this framework is provided in [Getting Started](./doc/GettingStarted.md).
To build the full documentation, run `doxygen` in the root directory of the project (this directory) and it will generate it in the directory `./Documentation/`
